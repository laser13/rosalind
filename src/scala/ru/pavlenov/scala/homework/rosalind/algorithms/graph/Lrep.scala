 * Finding the Longest Multiple Repeat 
 * http://rosalind.info/problems/lrep/
 *
 * Given:
 * A DNA string s (of length at most 20 kbp) with $ appended, a positive integer k, and a list of edges defining the suffix tree of s. Each edge is represented by four components:  the label of its parent node in T(s); the label of its child node in T(s); the location of the substring t of s∗ assigned to the edge; and the length of t.
 *
 * Return:
 * The longest substring of s that occurs at least k times in s. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
